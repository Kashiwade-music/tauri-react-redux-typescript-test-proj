# Tauri App with React Redux (Typescript)

## How To 
1. `yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit`
2. `yarn add react-redex`
3. `yarn add @types/react-redux`
4. create a file named `src/app/store.ts` and write a code

```ts
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {},
});

// Infer the `RootState` and `AppDispatch` types from the store itself
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
// Inferred type: {posts: PostsState, comments: CommentsState, users: UsersState}
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;

```

5. edit `src/index.tsx` as below

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";
import reportWebVitals from "./reportWebVitals";
import * as store from "./app/store"; // add
import { Provider } from "react-redux"; // add

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider store={store.store}> {/* add */}
      <App />
    </Provider> {/* add */}
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
```
6. create a file named `src/features/counter/counterSlice.ts` and write a code

```ts
import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import * as store from "../../app/store";

// Define a type for the slice state
interface CounterState {
  value: number;
}

// Define the initial state using that type
const initialState: CounterState = {
  value: 0,
};

export const slice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It
      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the immer library,
      // which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new
      // immutable state based off those changes
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action: PayloadAction<number>) => {
      state.value += action.payload;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = slice.actions;

// The function below is called a thunk and allows us to perform async logic. It
// can be dispatched like a regular action: `dispatch(incrementAsync(10))`. This
// will call the thunk with the `dispatch` function as the first argument. Async
// code can then be executed and other actions can be dispatched
export const incrementAsync =
  (amount: number) => (dispatch: store.AppDispatch) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      dispatch(incrementByAmount(amount));
    }, 1000);
  };

// The function below is called a selector and allows us to select a value from
// the state. Selectors can also be defined inline where they're used instead of
// in the slice file. For example: `useSelector((state) => state.counter.value)`
export const selectCount = (state: store.RootState) => state.counter.value;

export default slice.reducer;



```

7. add reducers to the store
```ts
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "../features/counter/counterSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: { counter: counterReducer }, // add
});

// Infer the `RootState` and `AppDispatch` types from the store itself
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
// Inferred type: {posts: PostsState, comments: CommentsState, users: UsersState}
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
```

8. create a file named `src/features/counter/Counter.tsx` and write a code

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import {
  decrement,
  increment,
  incrementByAmount,
  incrementAsync,
  selectCount,
} from "./counterSlice";

export function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector(selectCount);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const [incrementAmount, setIncrementAmount] = useState("2");

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button
          aria-label="Increment value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}
        >
          +
        </button>
        <span>{count}</span>
        <button
          aria-label="Decrement value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}
        >
          -
        </button>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input
          aria-label="Set increment amount"
          value={incrementAmount}
          onChange={(e) => setIncrementAmount(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button
          onClick={() =>
            dispatch(incrementByAmount(Number(incrementAmount) || 0))
          }
        >
          Add Amount
        </button>
        <button
          onClick={() => dispatch(incrementAsync(Number(incrementAmount) || 0))}
        >
          Add Async
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

```




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
